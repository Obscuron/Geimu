# General Ideas
 - Roguelike
 - Topdown
 - Shooter
 - Puzzle?

 - high skill cap?
 - simple/vectorized graphics?
 - unlockable classes based on shapes?
 - possible procedural generation of map layout
 - items/buffs (per run or persists over all runs?)
	- per run makes it require more skill and allows more differing playstyles
	- persistance allows more rpg-style and gives more senese of accomplishments
 - infinite? or a set goal?
	- infinite seems harder to implement and remain engaging cause gameplay falls off unless user
	  has the ability to change the world (see: minecraft/terraria) or have some progression (see: cubeworld)
	- set goal better imo, having certain amount of lvls to beat, or # of bosses, or some weird mechanic?
 - Having few specialty skills/abilities for classes for simplistic gameplay?
	- harder to create many different ability per class and keep them balanced
	- more engaging with fewer skills but more innovative ways to use?
	- instead, we can put more focus on buffs/items earned during each run
	
 - game length (given limited game)
	- longer games are definately more strategy based (see: nethack has a LOT of strategy and preparation involved)
	- shorter games are much easier to jump into and is less devestating to the player upon death
	- how long should a successful run be?
		- nethack has very long run times (possibly 10hrs + if new beginner) and very unforgiving
		- binding of isaac/spelunky are more around the time with upper cap at an hr per full run
		- rogue legacy begins with runs as short as 3-5 minutes, and is even maybe 30 mins at full length

 - how roguelike do we want this?
	- full rogue-like: previous runs have no affect upon future
		- entirely skill based
		- not as engaging imo
		- more suitable for very fast paced games
	- having few interaction
		- nethack has the ability to find your previous game's dead bodies and loot some cursed loot
		- binding of isaac remembers info from previous games played (during current session, so only while game
		  is still open) to modify some small percentages. Ex. chance of having an "angel" room is increased given
		  you having a previous run with passing over a "devil" room
		- spelunky allows you to start at future levels to skip both the risk of earlier levels and the rewards gotten
		  (you have the choice to start any level you've beaten i think)
	- progressive rpg elements?
		- rogue legacy offers a new world everytime, but you have an 'inventory' and stats and bonuses you you can level up
		  over time which persist to all future runs. Requires time invested into the game rather than having a more steeper
		  skill cap.

	
# Possible gimmicks?
 - evolution of shapes over time of play?
 - ability to encounter your past self
	- very hard to code, AI-wise, i would assume
 - some simple manipulation of the world?
	- either on a per run basis where you physically modify the world as you play
	- or indirectly modifying the (future) world based on your actions (modify next level?)
	- or slightly modifying your next/or future game worlds?
	- this seems like a very small gimmick, iunno
 - psudo-3d environments?
	- you can kind of travel in a 3rd "height" dimension which causes backgrounds to fade in and out
	- hard to implement on a graphical level i would assume
 - possible co-op?
	- either on same comp, or through internet? very different implementations and UI systems.


# Stuff we talked about during chat that I still remember
 - Possible change of genre to puzzle?
 - goal: try to find the "correct" world by traversing many worlds
	- each world could be randomized?
	- this could either be with set puzzles while keeping some randomness
	- or we can forgo puzzles and go with more randomness?
 - chaos theory or butterfly effect of some sort?
 	- double layered implementation, one is more "surface" level where the player would have more interaction with, while other is more lower level that takes into account of minute details for an implementation of chaos theory
